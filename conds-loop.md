# SELECTIVE CONTROL STRUCTURES <h1>
  
  **Control structures**
  
According to the structure theorem, any computer program can be written using the basic control structures. They can be combined in any way necessary to deal with a given problem.

**True or False**

The selection structure tests a condition, then executes one sequence of statements instead of another, depending on whether the condition is true or false. A condition is any variable or expression that returns a Boolean value.

The iteration structure executes a sequence of statements repeatedly as long as a condition holds true. The sequence structure simply executes a sequence of statements in the order in which they occur.
